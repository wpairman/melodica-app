# üì± App Store Submission Guide for Melodica

This guide covers everything you need to get Melodica on the iOS App Store and Google Play Store.

## üéØ Current Status

Your app is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** which means:
- ‚úÖ Users can already install it via "Add to Home Screen" on mobile
- ‚úÖ It works offline with service workers
- ‚úÖ It has app-like functionality
- ‚ö†Ô∏è To get on official app stores, you need to wrap it as a native app

## üöÄ Quick Start Options

### Option 1: PWA Only (Easiest - No App Store)
Users can install directly from the browser:
- **iOS**: Safari ‚Üí Share ‚Üí Add to Home Screen
- **Android**: Chrome ‚Üí Install App

**Pros:** Free, instant, no approval process  
**Cons:** Limited discoverability, users need to visit your website first

### Option 2: Capacitor (Recommended - Native Apps)
Wrap your PWA with Capacitor to create native iOS/Android apps.

**Pros:** Native app experience, app store distribution, push notifications  
**Cons:** Requires developer accounts ($99/year iOS + $25 one-time Android)

### Option 3: PWABuilder (Microsoft)
Free tool to package PWA for app stores.

**Pros:** Free, easy, Microsoft handles some complexity  
**Cons:** Less control, Microsoft account required

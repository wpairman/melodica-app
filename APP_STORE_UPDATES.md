# Updating Your App After App Store Release

## 🔄 How Updates Work

When you release Melodica to the App Store or Google Play, here's how to make changes and push updates:

## 📱 For iOS App Store

### Initial Release Process:
1. Build your app using Xcode or a PWA wrapper (like Capacitor/React Native)
2. Upload to App Store Connect
3. Submit for review ($99/year Apple Developer Account needed)
4. Wait for approval (typically 1-3 days)

### Making Updates After Release:

#### Option 1: Web Updates (Instant - Recommended for PWA)
Since Melodica is a Progressive Web App (PWA), **most updates don't require App Store resubmission**:

1. **Make your changes** in the codebase
2. **Commit and push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **Deploy to Netlify/Vercel** (auto-deploys)
4. **Users automatically get updates** the next time they open the app

**What can be updated instantly:**
- New features
- Bug fixes
- UI improvements
- Content changes
- New pages/routes

**What requires App Store resubmission:**
- Changes to native app capabilities (permissions, push notifications setup)
- Updates to `app.json` or native configuration
- Major version updates (e.g., 1.0 to 2.0)

#### Option 2: Native App Updates (Requires Resubmission)
If you've wrapped Melodica as a native app:

1. **Make changes** to your code
2. **Update version numbers** in your build configuration
3. **Build new version:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Then build iOS app in Xcode
   ```
4. **Upload to App Store Connect**
5. **Submit for review** (can take 1-3 days)
6. **Wait for approval**

## 🤖 For Google Play Store

### Similar Process:

#### Web Updates (Instant - Recommended for PWA)
Same as iOS - push to GitHub and it auto-deploys.

#### Native App Updates (Requires Submission)
1. Update version code in `build.gradle` or `app.json`
2. Build new APK/AAB
3. Upload to Google Play Console
4. Submit for review (typically faster than iOS, 1-24 hours)

## ⚡ Best Strategy for Melodica

**Since you have a PWA**, here's the recommended approach:

### Weekly/Monthly Updates:
```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update features"
git push origin main

# Netlify auto-deploys - done!
```

### Version Management:
1. Keep your web app at the latest version
2. Users always get the latest features automatically
3. Only submit to App Stores for:
   - Initial launch
   - Major architectural changes
   - Native feature additions

## 🔄 CI/CD Setup (Already Configured!)

Your app already has automated deployment:
- **GitHub**: Stores your code
- **Netlify**: Auto-deploys on every push
- **No manual steps needed** for most updates

## 📊 Version Tracking

You can track versions in your code:

```json
// package.json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",  // Update this for major releases
  ...
}
```

Or create a version file:
```javascript
// app/version.ts
export const APP_VERSION = "1.0.0"
export const LAST_UPDATED = "2024-01-15"
```

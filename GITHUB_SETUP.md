# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `melodica-app`
3. Description: "Mental Wellness Companion App"
4. Choose Public or Private
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README"
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: After Creating the Repository

Once the repository is created, GitHub will show you instructions. You'll see a page that looks like this:

```
Quick setup â€” if you've done this kind of thing before
Set up in Desktop
or
HTTPS      https://github.com/wpairman/melodica-app.git
SSH        git@github.com:wpairman/melodica-app.git
```

## Step 3: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, come back here and let me know when it's ready!

The repository needs to exist on GitHub before you can push to it.
